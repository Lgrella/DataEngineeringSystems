# Data Engineering Systems Week 9 Mini-Project

*   This project attempts to setup, configuration, and perform data manipulation in colab

**This notebook performs the following activities:**


1.   Reads in data using the yahoo finance api
2.   Determine which pairs are cointegrated/correlated for the concept of pairs trading in quant finance
3.   Visualizes this cointegration
4.   Determines the threshold for when we should long and short each chosen cointegrated pair
5.   Throughout the exercise, I perform a variety of data visualizations mostly focused on line graphs and heat maps.
